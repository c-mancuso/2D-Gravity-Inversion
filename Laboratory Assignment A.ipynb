Inversion of gravity data has been practiced now for several years for geophysical imaging in both two and three dimensions. Applying 2D methods is much more efficient than 3D as the processing load is lowered in proportion to the number of parameters required to compute. Depending on the amount of apriori knowledge, different methods can be chosen for 2D gravity inversion.\n","\n","In this exercise, a computational tool for the development and implementation of a published method of 2D forward and inversion modelling has been designed using the prism discretization method presented by Blakely (1996). The forward and inverse modeling and inversion code was written in Julia, an expressive programming language designed for high-performance computing which can rapid perform parameter estimation using novel parallelization schemes.\n","\n","## Environment setup\n","\n","Run the following code blocks to import the necessary libraries.
