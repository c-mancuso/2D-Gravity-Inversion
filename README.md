2D-Gravity-Inversion 2019
2D Gravity Inversion with Depth, Compactness and Geologic Constraints

Made for a class project. Ran with a model containing 10^4 parameters
in about 4 hours, and produced am interpretable image with many compact
features. Comparable with results from the publication: "A method for
2-dimensional inversion of gravity data." by Atankhah, S., E. Ardestani,
and M. Ashtari Jafari. (2014)

Outputs a numpy file for plotting in Python, but that can easily be
modified for whatever is suitable.
